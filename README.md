# LulzoMent

Since there are so many computers around the globe doing nothing productive, I thought of making a synchronyzed DoS attack tool in python.
The program is currently in the early development stage, so I have't added a lot of features yet.

This is mostly for the anons there that don't know how to code or hack and the people that don't want to feel useless.

You are welcome to give me suggestions.

Note: I am not responsable for any damage done with this tool. So don't blame me if you end up in court.
Also, I've designed this in the spirit of OpRedScare and OpRussia that are ongoing at the time of writing, so please use it for that.

### Linux
This should work on any Linux distro as long as you have Python3 installed.\
However, you have to install some packages first. I would put them in a `requirements.txt` file, but I don't know how to.\
So here's the instalation:

`git clone https://github.com/seahorse1seahorse/LulzoMent`\
`cd LulzoMent`\
`pip3 install colorama`\
`chmod +x lulzo-momento.py`\
`./lulzo-momento.py`


### Windows:
Um, download the file and run it in the Terminal. I haven't really tested it there so idk.\
Btw install `colorama` with `pip3 install colorama`

#### Usage:
`./lulzo-momento.py -t [target ip] -p [target port] <other options>`\
Note: The `-t` or `--target` argument is not optional and always the first, the `-p` or `--port` argument is optional and always the second.
